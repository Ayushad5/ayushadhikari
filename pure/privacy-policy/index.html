    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>Last updated: April 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Privacy Policy for PURE (Pure Understanding of Real Economics). We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing transparency about our practices.</p>
    
    <h2>Zero Data Collection</h2>
    <p>PURE does not collect any personal data, financial information, or usage statistics from you. We believe your financial data belongs only to you, and we have designed our application with privacy as a core principle.</p>
    
    <h2>Offline Application</h2>
    <p>PURE operates completely offline. All your financial data, transactions, budgets, and other information are stored locally on your device only. We do not have servers to store your data and cannot access your information under any circumstances.</p>
    
    <h2>Limited Internet Usage</h2>
    <p>PURE only uses internet connectivity for two specific purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Displaying Google advertisements (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Occasionally fetching current currency exchange rates when using the currency converter feature</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personal or financial data is transmitted during these operations.</p>
    
    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All your financial data is stored exclusively on your device using local storage mechanisms. This data remains on your device unless you explicitly choose to export it. We have no ability to access this data.</p>
    
    <h2>User Control</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data. At any time, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Export your data to a file for your personal backup</li>
        <li>Delete all your data from the application</li>
        <li>Manage your information directly through the app interface</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The only third-party services potentially used in PURE are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google AdMob for displaying advertisements</li>
        <li>Currency exchange rate API for updating conversion rates</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services operate under their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review Google's privacy policy if you're concerned about ad-related data practices.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take the security of your data seriously:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data is stored locally on your device</li>
        <li>Sensitive information can be protected with biometric authentication or PIN codes</li>
        <li>We utilize secure storage mechanisms for any sensitive financial information</li>
        <li>We do not store or transmit your financial data to external servers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>App Permissions</h2>
    <p>PURE may request the following permissions for specific features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Notification permission: For bill reminders and budget alerts</li>
        <li>Storage permission: For exporting your financial data</li>
        <li>Biometric authentication: For securing access to the app (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used solely for the stated purposes and do not enable any data collection.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>PURE does not knowingly collect any data from children under 13 years of age. Since our app doesn't collect user data at all, this includes children's data as well.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the app feedback feature or at the email address provided in our app store listing.</p>
